          Hi! I'm Aditya, and I like making intelligent machines. As an <a href="#" onclick="reveal('edu')">undergrad</a>, I major in Computer Science.<br><br>
          Over the years, I've worked on quite a few <a href="#" onclick="reveal('research')">projects</a> involving both <b>fundamental and applied work in AI, particularly in neural networks</b>. I've done research trying to develop <b>biologically-motivated neural learning</b> systems while also applying ML/DL in areas including <b>healthcare, conservation, astronomy, and heliophysics.</b><br><br>
          I've worked with a wide range of learning models, spanning spiking networks, CNNs, transformers, RNNs, GANs, LSMs/ESNs, MLPs, and more. I've also worked with a variety of non-DL machine learning models. I'm proficient in Python and familiar with PyTorch, Tensorflow, Keras, scikit-learn, Numpy, SciPy, Pandas, and many more common Python libraries/tools.<br><br>
          I also have <b>broad experience in both research and computer programming.</b> In the past, I'd done a lot of work with a range of web langauges and frameworks in addition to projects using Java, C,  and C++. My experience in machine learning and general research has also given me a good amount of exposure to <b>data science</b>, which has enabled me to make significant contributions even in non-CS domains.

        <a href="#" class="alohomora" onclick="reveal('worm')">What's the worm doing?</a><br>
        <div id="worm" class="hidden" name="content">
          The worm on your screen is using the "brain" of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans"><i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i></a>, a roundworm. If I'm being dramatic, this webpage is sort of like the <font color="#03A062">Matrix</font>, but for worms.<br><br>
          More specifically, your computer is currently simulating the <i>C. elegans</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome">connectome</a> in real time, using simple perfect intergrate-and-fire-type neurons. After a random initialization, the worm is frequently given arbitrary chemosensory stimuli (sensing <a href="https://youtu.be/vkvdAznoFqY">virtual food</a>) at random intervals as well as tactile feedback when it hits the walls of the webpage. Its muscular reactions (in the form of squiggling motions) are mapped through a simple singular velocity computation, producing the smoother travel of the worm on the screen.<br><br>
          The code and connectome are based off of the open-source <a href="https://openworm.org/">OpenWorm project</a> (more specifically, the <a href="https://docs.openworm.org/Projects/c-elegans-robot/"><i>C. elegans</i> robot project</a>).
